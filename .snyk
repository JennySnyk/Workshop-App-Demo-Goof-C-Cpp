# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file

# This is an example .snyk file for the vulnerable C++ application
# In a real application, you would use this to ignore false positives
# or apply patches. Since this is intentionally vulnerable, we don't
# want to ignore the findings!

# To ignore specific vulnerabilities (example - don't use for this repo):
# ignore:
#   SNYK-CPP-OPENSSL-123456:
#     - '*':
#         reason: Accepted risk for demo purposes
#         expires: 2025-12-31T00:00:00.000Z

version: v1.22.0

# Patch configuration (example)
# patch: {}

# Exclude paths from scanning (example)
# exclude:
#   code:
#     - tests/
#   global:
